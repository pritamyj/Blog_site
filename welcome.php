            ‚ÄúSir?‚Äù I‚Äôm not dreaming. The coffee is here so I scramble, or more accurately stumble, out of bed, pull on some clothes and unzip the room divider screen so that I can make my way to the screen at the tent‚Äôs front entry and unzip that.

Breakfast is at 8:00 and I again had the opportunity to have a lengthy conversation with campmate Richard. His story would make a great book and I have taken the liberty to introduce him, via email, to Amy Butler at thestoryscribe.com should he be interested and/or need expert assistance to pursue the idea.Packed, I check out and depart at 10:00 in the back seat of Mr. Kalika‚Äôs Toyota. The drive‚Äîa bit over an hour‚Äîis instructive but not remarkable.

            <p class="img_data">One might think that driving the same roads in the same area over and over and over again would get monotonous. The difference here is that the animals‚Äîexcept for perhaps the water-hole bully buffalo‚Äîare always moving. Elephants seen at one place one day are not there the next. Leopards, the most elusive Yala creature‚Äîare territorial but moving about‚Äîand hiding‚Äîwithin that territory. So, when we board the Toyota truck and enter the park from the same place at the same time, it is anything other than the same.

In the southeast of the island, it borders the Indian Ocean and is the country‚Äôs second largest national park but lays claim to being the most visited. Designated as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, you have seen that it hosts Sri Lankan leopards, Sri Lankan elephants, lots of birds along with the occasional sloth bear and lots of water buffalo.

Avinka explained that it was good to be first in. Today, however, there are very few vehicles in the park so, when we encountered ‚ÄúJ‚Äù at about 7:30, we were alone with him and it stayed that way. But only for a bit as he had places to be which took him stealthily behind the bush and out of our sight.

I was the only first class or business class passenger to Colombo on this 777-300ER, tail number A6EPM. This plane holds 8 in first class, 42 in business class and 304 more in economy class. I suspect that no more than 100 of the seats in the back were occupied but I cannot say that for certain.
